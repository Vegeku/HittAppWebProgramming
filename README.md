## Key features
REMOVE ME: Introduce the key features, paying special attention to the non-code ones.  Tell us briefly how to find & use them, and describes the reasons behind the design decisions you made in their implementation.  

### Create Workout/Description.
To create a workout you press the "Press button to add a Workout button". That brings you to a new page that allows you to create a workout my giving it a name, difficulty. You have the option to cancel you action by pressing the "Cancel Workout" button.

### Edit Workout/Description.
A workout can be edited only when they are once created. To do that, press the edit button. Once you press the edit button, you are different to an edit page that will allow you to edit and delete the workout.

### Add Exercise/Description.
Exercises are added within a workout. To do that, you need to start by pressing the "Press button to add a Workout button", from there you have to press the "Add Exercise" button, which will allow you to add an exercise.

>  I used ChatGPT to help me delete an exercise, this gave me code that allowed my to find out why my code wasn't working

I see, if the delete and edit buttons are encapsulated within the shadow DOM of the exercise-info element, you'll need a different approach to handle events for these buttons. One common approach is to dispatch custom events from within the shadow DOM and listen for these events outside of the shadow DOM.

Here's how you can implement this:

Inside the exercise-info custom element, add event listeners to the delete and edit buttons. When clicked, these buttons will dispatch custom events with relevant information (e.g., the index of the exercise).
Outside of the exercise-info custom element, listen for these custom events and handle them accordingly (e.g., call the deleteExercise() or editExercise() method).
First, let's modify the exercise-info custom element to dispatch custom events when the delete and edit buttons are clicked:

javascript
Copy code
// Inside the connectedCallback() method of the Exercise class
connectedCallback() {
    // Existing code...

    // Add event listeners to delete and edit buttons
    const deleteButton = this.shadow.querySelector('.delete-button');
    const editButton = this.shadow.querySelector('.edit-button');

    deleteButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        const event = new CustomEvent('deleteExercise', {
            bubbles: true,
            detail: { index: this.index }
        });
        this.dispatchEvent(event);
    });

    editButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        const event = new CustomEvent('editExercise', {
            bubbles: true,
            detail: { index: this.index }
        });
        this.dispatchEvent(event);
    });
}
Next, outside of the exercise-info custom element, listen for these custom events:

javascript
Copy code
// Where you define your custom elements (outside of exercise-info)
document.addEventListener('deleteExercise', (event) => {
    const index = event.detail.index;
    // Call deleteExercise() method with the index
});

document.addEventListener('editExercise', (event) => {
    const index = event.detail.index;
    // Call editExercise() method with the index
});
With this approach, you don't need direct access to the shadow DOM of the exercise-info custom element. Instead, you use custom events to communicate between the exercise-info element and its parent or other elements outside of its shadow DOM.


>  I was trying to figure out why my a certain if startement wasn't working, this allows me to debug my code and fix the issue.

 why is  this.editExercise(); not showing when I set the editable attribute 
to true

ChatGPT
The editExercise() method is not showing when you set the editable attribute to true because the editable attribute getter is returning a string value ("true") instead of a boolean value (true). In JavaScript, when you compare a string with a boolean using ==, the string is coerced to a boolean, and in this case, "true" is considered truthy.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the editable attribute getter returns a boolean value when the attribute is set to "true". Here's how you can update the editable attribute getter:

javascript
Copy code
get editable() {
    const value = this.getAttribute('editable');
    return value === 'true'; // Return true if the attribute value is 'true', otherwise false
}
With this change, the editable attribute getter will return a boolean value based on whether the attribute value is "true" or not. This should enable the editExercise() method to be called when the editable attribute is set to true.





>this made me figure out why I couldn't get any exercise

Simplify Code: Temporarily simplify your code to isolate the issue. For example, try adding a single exercise-info element directly to the shadow DOM without looping through an array, and see if you can access it.

  make button appear only when the user selects a workout by hovering over it, make it work on mobile as well



To modify the HTML and CSS to make the buttons appear only when the user hovers over a workout and to ensure it works on mobile as well, you can use a combination of CSS for hover effects and JavaScript to handle touch events on mobile devices. Since CSS hover states don't naturally trigger on most touch devices, using JavaScript is a practical solution.

Here is how you can achieve this functionality:

HTML and CSS Adjustments
Add CSS for Hovering: First, modify the CSS to hide the buttons by default and only show them when the parent element (li) is hovered over. You can also use JavaScript to simulate hover on touch devices.
Add JavaScript for Mobile Touch: Since mobile devices don't support hover in the same way as desktops, you'll need to add some JavaScript to toggle a class when an item is tapped which will show the buttons.
Here's how you can adjust your CSS and HTML:

CSS:
Add this to your existing stylesheet:

css
Copy code
/* Initially hide buttons in the list item */
li button {
    display: none;
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.3s;
}

/* Show buttons when the list item is hovered or has an 'active' class */
li:hover button,
li.active button {
    display: block;
    opacity: 1;
}
HTML:
Your HTML templates can stay the same. You need to add the JavaScript functionality.

JavaScript:
You need to add an event listener for touch events to simulate hover effects. Below is an example script that you could link or include inline in your HTML file.

JavaScript (exercise.js):
javascript
Copy code
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    // Get all list items
    const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");

    // Function to toggle 'active' class
    const toggleActive = (event) => {
        // Toggle 'active' class on the clicked list item
        event.currentTarget.classList.toggle("active");
    };

    // Attach event listeners to each list item for touch screens
    listItems.forEach(li => {
        li.addEventListener("touchstart", toggleActive);
    });
});
Notes:
Event Delegation: If list items (li) are dynamically generated, consider using event delegation attached to a parent element to manage events on dynamically created elements.
Multiple Touches: The above example handles simple touches. If your application needs to handle more complex gestures or multiple touches, consider using additional event listeners or a library like Hammer.js.
Performance: For performance reasons, toggling the class and using CSS for visibility changes is generally more efficient than manipulating styles directly through JavaScript.
This approach gives you a responsive UI that adapts to both desktop and mobile environments, ensuring a good user experience across devices.








To enhance your Fitness HIIT App with a beep sound and color change when moving to the next exercise, you need to add audio feedback and visual cues in the JavaScript logic managing the workout session transitions. Let's integrate these features into your existing code.

Adding Audio Feedback
You've already implemented a function to play a click noise when certain buttons are clicked (buttonSoundEffect). For the beep sound when transitioning to a new exercise, you should use a similar approach but with a different sound file:

Add a New Sound File: Ensure you have a short beep sound file available in your project's directory (e.g., beep.mp3).
Function to Play Beep Sound:
javascript
Copy code
function beepSound() {
    const beep = new Audio('../audio/beep.mp3');  // Ensure the path matches your project structure
    beep.play();
}
Changing Color for Visual Feedback
To visually signify moving to the next exercise, you can change the background color of the element displaying the current exercise. This can help users see at a glance that a new exercise has started.

CSS Addition:
Add a class in your CSS for highlighting the current exercise:
css
Copy code
.highlight {
    background-color: #4CAF50;  // Green background for emphasis
    color: white;  // White text for better readability
    transition: background-color 0.5s ease-in-out;  // Smooth transition for the background change
}
JavaScript Logic to Apply Highlighting:
Update your changeExercise function to add/remove this class when transitioning between exercises:
javascript
Copy code
function changeExercise(current, next) {
    el.exercise.textContent = current;
    el.nextExercise.textContent = next;
    el.exercise.classList.add('highlight');  // Add highlight to the current exercise

    // Remove the highlight after a short delay to make it noticeable
    setTimeout(() => {
        el.exercise.classList.remove('highlight');
    }, 1500);  // Highlight for 1.5 seconds
}
Integrating Beep and Color Change
Incorporate these functions into the main workout logic, specifically within the changeTimer function to trigger at the moment the exercise transitions:

javascript
Copy code
function changeTimer() {
    if (parseInt(el.duration.textContent) <= 0 && el.currentIndex < el.exerciseList.length - 1) {
        beepSound();  // Play beep sound on transition
        el.currentIndex += 1;
        el.duration.textContent = el.exerciseList[el.currentIndex].time;
        el.timeLeft.textContent = parseInt(el.timeLeft.textContent) - parseInt(el.exerciseList[el.currentIndex].time);
        if (el.currentIndex + 1 < el.exerciseList.length) {
            changeExercise(el.exerciseList[el.currentIndex].name, el.exerciseList[el.currentIndex + 1].name);
        } else if (el.currentIndex + 1 === el.exerciseList.length) {
            changeExercise(el.exerciseList[el.currentIndex].name, 'no more exercises left');
        }
    } else if (parseInt(el.duration.textContent) > 0) {
        el.duration.textContent = parseInt(el.duration.textContent) - 1;
    }
}
Conclusion
With these modifications, your app will provide auditory and visual feedback at each transition between exercises, enhancing the user experience. Make sure the paths to your audio files are correct and test the app to ensure the timing and behavior of the transitions are as expected. This will help keep your users engaged and aware of their progress during workouts.

> helped me fix a bug with my code

The getData function in your code is responsible for retrieving data from the session storage and processing it.

First, it retrieves a stringified JSON object from the session storage with the key 'exercises'. This object is then parsed into a JavaScript object and assigned to the workoutExercises variable.

Next, it retrieves another item from the session storage with the key 'totalTime' and assigns it to the totalTime property of the el object. It's important to note that the value retrieved from the session storage is always a string. If 'totalTime' is supposed to be a number, you might need to convert it using parseInt or parseFloat.

Then, it attempts to map over the exercises property of the workoutExercises object. For each exercise in the exercises array, it tries to parse it as JSON. However, there's a mistake here. The result of JSON.parse(exercise) is not returned from the arrow function, so the map operation will result in an array of undefined values. To fix this, you should return the result of JSON.parse(exercise) from the arrow function.

Finally, it logs the workoutExercises object and the exerciseList property of the el object to the console. This is likely for debugging purposes.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

function getData() {
  const workoutStorage = sessionStorage.getItem('exercises');
  const workoutExercises = JSON.parse(workoutStorage);
  el.totalTime = parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem('totalTime'), 10);
  el.exerciseList = workoutExercises.exercises.map((exercise) => JSON.parse(exercise));
  console.log(workoutExercises);
  console.log(el.exerciseList);
}

In this version, parseInt is used to convert 'totalTime' to a number, and the result of JSON.parse(exercise) is returned from the arrow function in the map operation.

> was getting errors with passing json with session storage
pass a list of objects from one file to another using sessionStorage

Using `sessionStorage` to pass a list of objects from one JavaScript file to another within the same browsing session is straightforward. The `sessionStorage` object stores data as strings, so to save objects, you must serialize them to a string using `JSON.stringify()`. You can then retrieve them in another file (or another part of the same file) by parsing the stored string back into objects with `JSON.parse()`.

### Steps to Pass a List of Objects Using sessionStorage

#### 1. Define and Store the Data
In the first file, or a part of your application, serialize your list of objects and store it in `sessionStorage`. For example:

```javascript
// Assume you have a list of objects
let exercises = [
    { name: "Push-ups", duration: 30, description: "Do as many push-ups as you can in 30 seconds." },
    { name: "Plank", duration: 45, description: "Hold a plank position for 45 seconds." },
    { name: "Squats", duration: 30, description: "Perform squats for 30 seconds." }
];

// Serialize and store it in sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('exercises', JSON.stringify(exercises));
```

#### 2. Retrieve and Use the Data
In the second file, or another part of your application, retrieve the string from `sessionStorage`, parse it to get the original list of objects, and use it as needed:

```javascript
// Retrieve the data
let storedExercises = sessionStorage.getItem('exercises');

// Check if there's any data
if (storedExercises) {
    // Parse the JSON string back into an array of objects
    let exercises = JSON.parse(storedExercises);

    // Now you can use 'exercises' as a normal array of objects
    console.log(exercises);

    exercises.forEach(exercise => {
        console.log(`${exercise.name}: ${exercise.description} for ${exercise.duration} seconds.`);
    });
} else {
    console.error('No exercises found in sessionStorage.');
}
```

### Considerations and Best Practices

- **Session Storage Scope**: `sessionStorage` is limited to the current browser tab. Data stored in one tab will not be accessible from another tab or another window.
- **Storage Limits**: The storage capacity for `sessionStorage` is limited (usually around 5MB). Be mindful of this if you're storing a large amount of data.
- **Data Persistence**: Data in `sessionStorage` persists only for the duration of the page session. It is cleared when the tab or the browser is closed.
- **Security and Privacy**: Since data stored in `sessionStorage` can be easily accessed via JavaScript, it should not be used to store sensitive information.
- **Browser Compatibility**: `sessionStorage` is widely supported in modern browsers, but always consider your target audience and their potential browser usage. For critical features, ensure to have a fallback mechanism.

Using `sessionStorage` is a simple and effective way to pass data between different parts of your JavaScript application during a single browser session.
