I used ChatGPT to help me delete an exercise

<!-- I see, if the delete and edit buttons are encapsulated within the shadow DOM of the exercise-info element, you'll need a different approach to handle events for these buttons. One common approach is to dispatch custom events from within the shadow DOM and listen for these events outside of the shadow DOM.

Here's how you can implement this:

Inside the exercise-info custom element, add event listeners to the delete and edit buttons. When clicked, these buttons will dispatch custom events with relevant information (e.g., the index of the exercise).
Outside of the exercise-info custom element, listen for these custom events and handle them accordingly (e.g., call the deleteExercise() or editExercise() method).
First, let's modify the exercise-info custom element to dispatch custom events when the delete and edit buttons are clicked:

javascript
Copy code
// Inside the connectedCallback() method of the Exercise class
connectedCallback() {
    // Existing code...

    // Add event listeners to delete and edit buttons
    const deleteButton = this.shadow.querySelector('.delete-button');
    const editButton = this.shadow.querySelector('.edit-button');

    deleteButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        const event = new CustomEvent('deleteExercise', {
            bubbles: true,
            detail: { index: this.index }
        });
        this.dispatchEvent(event);
    });

    editButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        const event = new CustomEvent('editExercise', {
            bubbles: true,
            detail: { index: this.index }
        });
        this.dispatchEvent(event);
    });
}
Next, outside of the exercise-info custom element, listen for these custom events:

javascript
Copy code
// Where you define your custom elements (outside of exercise-info)
document.addEventListener('deleteExercise', (event) => {
    const index = event.detail.index;
    // Call deleteExercise() method with the index
});

document.addEventListener('editExercise', (event) => {
    const index = event.detail.index;
    // Call editExercise() method with the index
});
With this approach, you don't need direct access to the shadow DOM of the exercise-info custom element. Instead, you use custom events to communicate between the exercise-info element and its parent or other elements outside of its shadow DOM.

 I was trying to figure out why my if statements weren't working
<!-- 
 why is  this.editExercise(); not showing when I set the editable attribute 
to true

ChatGPT
The editExercise() method is not showing when you set the editable attribute to true because the editable attribute getter is returning a string value ("true") instead of a boolean value (true). In JavaScript, when you compare a string with a boolean using ==, the string is coerced to a boolean, and in this case, "true" is considered truthy.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the editable attribute getter returns a boolean value when the attribute is set to "true". Here's how you can update the editable attribute getter:

javascript
Copy code
get editable() {
    const value = this.getAttribute('editable');
    return value === 'true'; // Return true if the attribute value is 'true', otherwise false
}
With this change, the editable attribute getter will return a boolean value based on whether the attribute value is "true" or not. This should enable the editExercise() method to be called when the editable attribute is set to true. -->

this made me figure out why I couldn't get any exercise

<!-- Simplify Code: Temporarily simplify your code to isolate the issue. For example, try adding a single exercise-info element directly to the shadow DOM without looping through an array, and see if you can access it. -->
